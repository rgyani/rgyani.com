Bubbles, helps you achieve your language learning goals, with an efficient approach by mastering the vocabulary, using interesting puzzles.

This is how it works:
* Once you have learnt the 500 most relevant words in a new language, you will be able to understand close to half the words in a typical text
* As your vocabulary expands to 1500 words, you will be able to understand upto 70% of all commonly used words in conversations, news and TV Shows.
* When you reach the 3000 words mark, you will be able to understand 8 out of every 10 words when conversing with a native speaker.
* Reaching a working vocabulary of over 5000 words will give you an optimal springboard to build fluency fast.
