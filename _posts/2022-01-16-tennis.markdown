In the current version, we have the following features
1. You can choose your player's character, decide if you want to be a baseline player or a serve-volley master, counter puncher or an all-rounder.
2. You select a venue, based on which, AI will select a player, and you compete against the player in a first to 7 points match.
3. While in the game, you can use swipes on the mobile screen to control your shots. The goal being, just like a real game, to place the ball out of reach of the player.
4. Currently, you can use forehand, backhand, volley and smash strokes. All animations are in place and I feel, work beautifully :)
5. If and when you win a match, you get some rewards, which take time to open (can be sped-up, via video ads and/or gems) and you get character cards, which you can use to upgrade your chosen character(s).
6. The upgraded characters have faster response times, better shot speed based on their characteristics
7. There is also a practice mode where you play against the Ball-Machine to fine tune your skills


### ToDo List:

1. PvP mode, where you can play online against another person, facebook friends in real-time. 
2. Tuning and more tuning, on the player characteristics, the shot height while returning, the player movement considering the energy etc/
3. Smoothing out the camera movement scripts
